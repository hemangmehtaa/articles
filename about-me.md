# About me

I have a degree in Software Engineering and a PGD in Advanced Computing from CDAC. In the past I have worked in various roles ranging from Software Engineer to Software Architect in different parts of the world. This blog, its contents and opinions are my own. I blog about technology, software architecture, entrepreneurship, culture and software engineering practices.
